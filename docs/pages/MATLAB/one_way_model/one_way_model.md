![one_way_data](one_way_data.png)

The three columns are as follows:
+ group - one of Organ donor, VAD, or Heart transplant - the linear mixed model will test whether there are statistical differences between values y from the 3 groups
+ person - indicates the "source" of the data. In this example, we have:
  + 2 measurements from Organ Donor a
  + 3 measurements from person d, one when they received a VAD, and 2 when they received a heart transplant
  + 2 measurements from person d, once whey received a VAD, and 1 when they received a heart transplant
+ y - the experimental data
